We propose new multistage computational-statistical strategies based on screening-network methods} that predict patient survival outcome by screening key survival-related genes. In particular, we use: (i) screening approaches to reduce the initial dimension from an high-dimensional space p to a moderate scale d; (ii) Cox-regression model for describing the relationship between patient survival times and predictor variables; (iii) network-penalized Cox-regression approaches to model observed survival time through  genome-wide omic profiles while accounting for coordinated functioning of genes in the form of biological pathways or networks.
In our previous studies [1,2], we showed the advantages of such approaches with respect to classical penalized cox-regression methods.
