We propose {\it new multistage computational-statistical strategies} based on \textcolor[rgb]{0.25, 0.0, 1.0}{\bf screening-network methods} that predict patient survival outcome by screening {\it key survival-related genes}. In particular, we use:
\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.25, 0.0, 1.0}{\bf screening approaches} to reduce the initial dimension from an high-dimensional space $p$ to a moderate scale $d$;
	\vspace{-0.2cm}
	\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.25, 0.0, 1.0}{\bf Cox-regression} model for describing the relationship between {\it patient survival times} and {\it predictor variables};
	\vspace{-0.2cm}
	\item \textcolor[rgb]{0.25, 0.0, 1.0}{\bf network-penalized Cox-regression approaches} to model observed survival time through {\it genome-wide omic profiles} while accounting for coordinated functioning of genes in the form of biological pathways or networks.
\end{itemize}	
\vspace{-0.2cm}
In our previous studies [1,2], we showed the advantages of such approaches with respect to classical penalized cox-regression methods.
